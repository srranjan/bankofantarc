Caution: Added the following 3 lines to .gitignore before running the following from triggered folder:
node_modules/
k8/tkn/triggered/node_modules/
.json - This one earlier than the above 2 lines
However, additionally I shall try to deleted node_modules and .json before any git add, but added these, just in case I blunder.


npm install express
node mywebhookreceiver.js
http://localhost:3030/webhook
Tested successfully using this:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1,"name":"Raju","phone":"1231231234","address":"1 Deer Creek","potalCd":"12345","type":"1","balance":"111"}'  http://localhost:3030/webhook

ngrok http http://localhost:3030
Went to the web page:    http://127.0.0.1:4040
Gave the IP address that led to a successful call from Linux (not from Windows due to format issue over there):

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1,"name":"Raju","phone":"1231231234","address":"1 Deer Creek","potalCd":"12345","type":"1","balance":"111"}'  https://55ba-173-71-124-112.ngrok-free.app/webhook

Also tested github push webhook event reaching http://localhost:3030 

This may help to trigger tekton.



Go through the following if you need help in ngrok set up:
ngrok
https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/?os=linux
https://ngrok.com/docs/using-ngrok-with/docker/

Created a google based account with ngrok.
https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/linux

curl -sSL https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc \
	| sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null \
	&& echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" \
	| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list \
	&& sudo apt update \
	&& sudo apt install ngrok
The above command was problematic but this following worked, at least it looks initially:
sudo snap install ngrok

ngrok config add-authtoken 2mejXbkR4IAqkpD1NQ8U5s7aIM7_4QXbqNo2XLXdoMfBBbyT7
Authtoken saved to configuration file: /home/rranjan/snap/ngrok/189/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml

Let me save the token at least:
2mejXbkR4IAqkpD1NQ8U5s7aIM7_4QXbqNo2XLXdoMfBBbyT7
https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/linux
A good page to glance at for authentication options.
